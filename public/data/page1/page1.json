    "description": "The bank hires around 1800 new starters a year. Historically, all branch induction courses were residential, asking people to stay away from home for 5+ weeks. \u2028\u2028We created a virtual, blended solution that both increased the effectiveness of the new starter journey and reduced costs to the business. The programme integrated core learning modules into the working lives of the new starter and they we able to remain in their new branch, amongst their peers supporting their learning journey on a practical level with social learning.\u2028\nThe new model for all 10 Branch roles included In-branch activities, digital content & games, film & animation, PDFs, reflection time, coaching & 121s (in branch & virtual), webinars and virtual observations for legal sign off.",
