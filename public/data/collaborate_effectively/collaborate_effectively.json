    "description": "We were contracted by Eon Next to help launching a new strategy to  78,000 people.\n\nAs part of this we  created an engaging and emotive film that reflected the passion, opinions and perspectives of E.ON’s colleagues and customers. Using authentic, honest and humorous interviews, shot in real home and work environments, the films had maximum relatability and impact.\n\nWe also created line manager led activities designed to draw out the practical actions each individual can make in order to drive the development of the business in the future. Teams were asked to celebrate and share their past achievements and drive excitement about the future possibilities.\n\nIn just three weeks, 90% of the audience had engaged with the hero content and completed the activities with their line manager. 94% agreed that they had a clear understanding of E.ON’s strategic direction."
